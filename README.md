# RunSecure

**Disposable, hardened containers for GitHub Actions self-hosted runners.**
One container per job. No persistent state. All outbound traffic filtered
through an egress proxy you control.

If you run self-hosted GH Actions runners on your own hardware, RunSecure
is the layer between "I need a runner" and "the runner can read my SSH
keys, push to my AWS, and stay alive between jobs."

---

## Why you might want this

Self-hosted runners on bare metal are a shared, persistent environment.
A compromised GitHub Action or a malicious npm dependency can:

- Read SSH keys, cloud credentials, and browser cookies from the host
- Send stolen secrets to an attacker-controlled domain
- Spawn background processes that survive the job finishing
- Reach your internal services and the cloud-provider metadata endpoint
  (`169.254.169.254`)

This isn't theoretical. The
[tj-actions/changed-files supply-chain attack](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mrrh-fhqg-pjh4)
in March 2025 did all of those things to every repo that used it.

GitHub-hosted runners avoid this with disposable VMs you don't pay for.
If you've moved to self-hosted runners (cost, GPU access, large memory,
private-network builds, ARM64), you've inherited the security model and
don't have an obvious replacement for the disposability.

RunSecure is that replacement.

---

## What it actually does

Each CI job runs in a fresh container that:

| Hardening | How |
|---|---|
| **Ephemeral** | `--rm`, destroyed the moment the job ends. No state survives. |
| **Non-root** | UID 1001, root account locked, shell set to nologin |
| **No capabilities** | `cap_drop: ALL` (only `NET_BIND_SERVICE` on the proxy) |
| **No privilege escalation** | `no-new-privileges:true`, all setuid bits stripped |
| **Restricted syscalls** | Custom seccomp profile blocks `ptrace`, `mount`, `bpf`, `keyctl`, `swapon`, etc. |
| **Read-only system paths** | `/etc` is `chmod 555`; `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` are `444` |
| **No package manager** | `apt`/`dpkg` removed in finalize-hardening; nothing can be installed at runtime |
| **No network recon tools** | `ping`, `nc`, `ssh`, `wget` removed |
| **Egress allowlist** | Network goes through Squid (HTTP/HTTPS) + HAProxy (raw TCP) + dnsmasq (DNS). Anything not on your allowlist is blocked. |
| **Cloud-metadata blocked** | `169.254.169.254`, `metadata.google.internal`, `fd00:ec2::254` all refused |
| **PID-1 reaping** | `init: true` ensures zombie processes don't accumulate |

The egress allowlist is the load-bearing piece. Even if a malicious
package executes inside the runner, it can't talk to anything you didn't
already approve. That's the property tj-actions/changed-files needed
the most and didn't have.

---

## What it explicitly does NOT do

- **Block exfiltration over allowed domains.** If you allow `github.com`,
  an attacker can still create issues, push to repos they control, or
  encode data in commit messages. The mitigation is workflow-level
  (`GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions, branch protection), not network-level.
- **Replace your need to vet third-party Actions.** RunSecure makes
  compromise less catastrophic, not impossible.
- **Solve secrets management.** Workflows that `set -x` or `echo $TOKEN`
  still leak secrets to the per-job log. RunSecure ships logs to GitHub
  via the runner's normal upload — encrypted at rest, but visible to
  anyone with the right repo permissions.
- **Provide multi-job isolation.** One runner = one container = one job.
  Run multiple instances of `run.sh` for parallel jobs.

For the full threat model, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Engine 20.10+** (or Docker Desktop / Colima — anything with
  `docker compose v2`)
- **`gh` CLI** authenticated against the GitHub repo whose CI you're
  hardening (used to request JIT runner tokens)
- **`yq` v4+** for parsing `runner.yml`
- **Linux or macOS host** with at least 8 GB RAM available (Node CI
  builds eat 4 GB on a busy day; 16 GB recommended on macOS where
  the VM steals memory)

```bash
# macOS
brew install docker colima yq gh
colima start --cpu 4 --memory 16 --vm-type vz --mount-type virtiofs
gh auth login

# Debian/Ubuntu
apt install docker.io gh
# yq: download from https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases (apt's yq is the wrong tool)
```

## Quick Start

> **Heads-up on versioning.** Releases follow a beta-first promotion
> pipeline:
>
> | Tag | Meaning | When to use |
> |---|---|---|
> | `1.2.3` (or `latest`) | Promoted to stable after acceptance suite passed against the same digest | **Production** — every consumer should pin one of these |
> | `1.2.3-beta` (or `nightly`) | Built and Grype-scanned, but acceptance results not yet validated | Bleeding-edge testing only — the digest may regress on a documented security claim |
>
> The `:1.2.3-beta` digest is byte-identical to `:1.2.3` after promotion
> — same artifact, just a server-side retag. If acceptance fails, the
> beta tag stays and no stable tag is created.

### Clone-and-run (recommended)

The orchestrator references files across the repo (`docker-compose.yml`,
`squid/Dockerfile`, the `lib/` helpers). It needs the repo on disk.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndEnd-Collective/RunSecure.git
cd RunSecure

# Build the base + the language layer you want
docker build -f images/base.Dockerfile -t runner-base:latest .
docker build -f images/node.Dockerfile --build-arg NODE_VERSION=24 -t runner-node:24 .
# (or python.Dockerfile / rust.Dockerfile)

# Create runner.yml in YOUR project (the repo whose CI you want hardened)
cat > /path/to/your-project/.github/runner.yml <<'YML'
runtime: node:24
http_egress:
  - .npmjs.org
  - .github.com
YML

# Update YOUR project's workflow to require the matching labels
# (in your-project/.github/workflows/ci.yml):
#   runs-on: [self-hosted, Linux, ARM64, container]

# Start a runner (picks up one job, then exits — re-run for the next)
./infra/scripts/run.sh --project /path/to/your-project --repo your-org/your-repo
```

That's it. The orchestrator will:

1. Read your `runner.yml` and validate it (rejects unknown fields)
2. Build a project-specific image layering any tools you specified
3. Start the egress proxy + the runner container on an isolated network
4. Request a JIT runner token from GitHub
5. Run one job, tear everything down

To process more than one job, run with `--max-jobs N` or just call
`run.sh` again. Each invocation is self-contained.

### Architecture mismatch warning

The default `labels:` is `[self-hosted, Linux, ARM64, container]`. If
you're on x86_64 (most non-Mac hardware), your workflow's `runs-on:`
won't match unless you override:

```yaml
# in runner.yml
labels: [self-hosted, Linux, X64, container]

# in your workflow
runs-on: [self-hosted, Linux, X64, container]
```

---

## `runner.yml` — the full schema

Only `runtime:` is required. Everything else has sensible defaults.

## How the egress proxy works

The runner container has **no direct internet route**. Its only network
peer is the proxy container, which sits on two networks: the
runner-only internal network and the host-reachable external bridge.

```
   YOUR JOB                  PROXY CONTAINER             INTERNET
   ┌────────────┐            ┌───────────────────┐       ┌──────────┐
   │  runner    │  HTTP/S    │  Squid :3128      │  ───▶ │ allowed  │
   │  container │ ─────────▶ │   (allowlist)     │       │ domains  │
   │            │            │                   │       └──────────┘
   │  HTTP_PROXY│  raw TCP   │  HAProxy :PORTS   │  ───▶ ┌──────────┐
   │  ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ │ ─────────▶ │   (per-port)      │       │ approved │
   │            │            │                   │       │ host:port│
   │            │  DNS       │  dnsmasq :53      │  ───▶ └──────────┘
   │            │ ─────────▶ │   (optional)      │
   └────────────┘            └───────────────────┘
   internal: true             dual-homed
```

- **Squid** filters HTTP/HTTPS by domain. CONNECT to anything not on
  the allowlist is refused. The runner gets `HTTP_PROXY` set
  automatically.
- **HAProxy** opens a TCP frontend on each `tcp_egress` port. Connecting
  to that port from the runner is forwarded to the configured
  destination only. Other TCP ports have no listener.
- **dnsmasq** (only when `dns.host: false`) runs DNS inside the proxy
  with your servers, optional `hosts_file` overrides, and optional
  `whitelist_file` enforcement.

The proxy is **fail-closed**: if Squid, HAProxy, or dnsmasq dies, the
proxy container exits and the runner's network calls start failing
immediately.

The base allowlist (built into `infra/squid/base.conf`) covers
`github.com`, `*.npmjs.org`, `*.pypi.org`, `crates.io`, `docker.io`,
GHCR, and a few CI-essential tools. Project-specific entries from
`http_egress:` are added on top.

---

## Testing

The full validation suite builds every language image and runs ~35
hardening checks against each (non-root, no setuid, no apt, locked
root, etc.):

```bash
./tests/validation/run-all-tests.sh             # all images
./tests/validation/run-all-tests.sh --quick     # skip Rust (slow)
./tests/validation/run-all-tests.sh --skip-build # reuse cached images
```

Integration tests bring up the proxy + runner stack on an isolated
Docker network and exercise CI workflows end-to-end:

```bash
./tests/integration/run-integration-tests.sh                  # all suites
./tests/integration/run-integration-tests.sh --test egress    # egress allowlist tests
./tests/integration/run-integration-tests.sh --test tcp       # HAProxy TCP egress
./tests/integration/run-integration-tests.sh --test dns       # dnsmasq paths
./tests/integration/run-integration-tests.sh --test attack    # simulated attacks
./tests/integration/run-integration-tests.sh --test node      # Node CI lifecycle
./tests/integration/run-integration-tests.sh --test python    # Python CI lifecycle
```

A separate Grype CVE scan runs in CI on every PR that touches
`images/` or `tools/`. The post-publish workflow re-scans every image
that gets pushed to GHCR — a HIGH/CRITICAL CVE with an upstream fix
blocks the publish.

---

## Post-publish acceptance tests

Every published release goes through an acceptance suite that exercises
the actual GHCR images against documented security claims. The workflow
(`.github/workflows/post-publish-acceptance.yml`) runs after
`Publish Images` succeeds:

1. Pulls the just-published `proxy` and `node`/`python` images from GHCR.
2. Brings up the proxy + runner stack with the documented hardening flags.
3. Runs **in-container checks** inside the runner: identity, root-locked,
   package-manager-removed, no-setuid, immutable `/etc`, `cap_drop`,
   `no-new-privileges`, `/tmp` noexec, seccomp blocks (`keyctl`,
   `perf_event_open`, `swapon`).
4. Runs **stack-level checks** through the running proxy: direct-internet
   blocked, HTTP allowlist enforced, cloud-metadata refused
   (`169.254.169.254`, `metadata.google.internal`), TCP egress allowlist
   enforced, HTTPS-only `CONNECT` enforcement.

Each check is tagged with a claim ID (`H01`, `R02`, `N03`, …) that maps
to a numbered claim in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md). A failure GATES THE
PROMOTION: the `-beta` tag exists and consumers can opt into it, but
the stable `<version>` and `latest` tags are not created until the
acceptance suite is fully green. The promotion (`promote-to-stable.yml`)
runs server-side via `docker buildx imagetools create` — no rebuild,
no pull, the stable tag points at the exact same digest the acceptance
suite validated.

To run the same suite locally against your dev images:

```bash
./tests/acceptance/run-locally.sh node 24
# or against a specific published version:
IMAGE_VERSION=1.1.2 ./tests/acceptance/run-locally.sh python 3.12
```

A lint (`tests/validation/test-acceptance-claim-coverage.sh`) prevents
new claim IDs from being added to checks without a corresponding header
that documents them — and without a matching entry in
`tests/acceptance/claims.yml` (the SARIF rule catalog).

### Findings in the Security tab (SARIF)

Every acceptance run uploads results to GitHub Code Scanning in
SARIF v2.1.0 format, one upload per language matrix leg:

```
post-publish-acceptance.yml
  ├── runs the suite (capture PASS:/FAIL:/SKIP: lines)
  ├── tests/acceptance/sarif-emitter.py
  │     ├── reads tests/acceptance/claims.yml (rule catalog)
  │     ├── reads the captured PASS/FAIL/SKIP output
  │     └── emits acceptance-<lang>-<ver>.sarif
  └── github/codeql-action/upload-sarif (category: acceptance-<lang>-<ver>)
```

What you see in the Security tab when a claim fails:

| Column | Value |
|---|---|
| **Rule** | `H03` — *"Package manager removed (apt/dpkg/aptitude)"* |
| **Severity** | error |
| **Description** | "Acceptance claim H03 FAILED for ghcr.io/.../node:1.2.3-beta-24: package manager 'apt' still present at /usr/bin/apt" |
| **Location** | `SECURITY.md` line 1 (anchor: layer-1-image-hardening-build-time) |
| **Help** | Markdown explaining the claim + link to the SECURITY.md section |
| **Fingerprint** | `claim/v1=H03 image-ref/v1=ghcr.io/.../node:1.2.3-beta-24` (deduplicates across runs) |

The `partialFingerprints` mean the same finding on the same image-ref
shows as one persistent issue across re-runs (not a new finding each
time), and a regression that re-introduces a previously-fixed claim
shows up as "new" even after dismissal — exactly what you want for a
security-claim audit trail.

SARIF is uploaded **always** (even when the workflow itself fails),
so failures land in the Security tab even when the gating step
re-raises the original exit code.

## Self-hosting RunSecure for its own CI

The repo dogfoods its own runner. The `dogfood.yml` workflow runs the
validation and unit lints on a RunSecure-hardened runner, proving the
runtime works for real CI workloads.

To bring it online, run the orchestrator on any Linux host with Docker
(or macOS with Colima):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndEnd-Collective/RunSecure.git
cd RunSecure

# Pick up dogfood.yml jobs as they queue — runs forever, one job per cycle
./infra/scripts/run.sh \
    --project . \
    --repo AndEnd-Collective/RunSecure \
    --max-jobs 100
```

For PR-time bootstrapping (drain the queue, exit when done) there's a
thin convenience wrapper with sanity checks (gh auth, Docker daemon,
runner.yml present):

```bash
./infra/scripts/dev/bootstrap-self-runner.sh        # default 5 jobs
./infra/scripts/dev/bootstrap-self-runner.sh 20     # override count
# Kill it explicitly when the queue is empty:
kill "$(cat _orchestrator-logs/orch.pid)"
```

The repo-root `.github/runner.yml` defines what the self-hosted runner
should look like (Node 24 base, minimal allowlist for `github.com` + PyPI,
ARM64 labels). When no orchestrator is running, `dogfood.yml`'s jobs
queue silently without blocking the rest of CI (`smoke-test`, `validate`,
`grype-scan` all run on `ubuntu-latest`).

**Why `dogfood.yml` doesn't run integration tests**: integration tests
spawn nested Docker (`docker-compose` brings up the proxy + a second
runner). Inside a hardened RunSecure container with `cap_drop: ALL` +
seccomp, that's intentionally blocked — it's the security property the
project is built around. The full integration suite continues to run on
`ubuntu-latest` via `smoke-test.yml`.

## Pre-push lint hook

A pre-push hook in `.githooks/pre-push` runs the same lints CI runs,
catching regressions before they leave your laptop. One-time setup:

```bash
./.githooks/install
```

Now `git push` runs all 11 lint files (~30s) and refuses to push on any
failure. To bypass in an emergency: `git push --no-verify`.

---

## Workflow log diagnostics

Every job run on a RunSecure runner gets two **automatic diagnostic
groups** in the GitHub Actions UI — no workflow changes required:

```
▶ RunSecure container — runtime posture
▶ RunSecure container — hardening properties
▶ RunSecure container — network posture
▶ RunSecure container — available toolchains
▶ RunSecure debugging pointers
```

These appear under "Job started hook" at the top of every workflow log.
The "hardening properties" group prints actual values — `CapEff`,
`NoNewPrivs`, seccomp mode, `/tmp` mount flags, `/etc` mode — so a user
debugging a job can verify the runtime is enforcing what RunSecure
documents, without cloning this repo.

The script lives at `infra/runner-hooks/job-started.sh`; it's wired in
via the actions-runner's `ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_STARTED` env var
(set in `images/base.Dockerfile`). A symmetric `job-completed.sh` runs
at job teardown with an exit summary.

Both hooks are fail-safe — non-zero exit from a hook would fail the
job per actions-runner contract, so each script wraps every command in
`|| true` and ends with `trap 'exit 0' ERR`. A diagnostic should
never be the reason a job fails.

## Operational notes

### Per-job logs land on the host

The runner's `_diag/` directory (the actions-runner's per-job worker
log) is bind-mounted to the orchestrator's working directory. When a
job crashes before logs upload, you still have `_diag/Worker_*.log`
locally for triage. One generation of rotation is kept in
`_diag.previous/`.

To turn this off (e.g. shared CI hosts where multiple users access the
disk):

```bash
RUNSECURE_DIAG_RETENTION=0 ./infra/scripts/run.sh ...
```

The synchronous log-upload-wait still ensures `gh api .../jobs/<id>/logs`
returns the actual log instead of `BlobNotFound`.

### JIT token exposure

The orchestrator passes the GitHub JIT runner token to the container
via the `RUNNER_JIT_CONFIG` environment variable. The entrypoint reads
it once and `unset`s it, but it's briefly visible to `docker inspect`
and to processes inside the container that read `/proc/1/environ`.

If you're running on a shared host where unprivileged users could
inspect container state, set `RUNNER_JIT_CONFIG_FILE` instead — the
entrypoint reads it from a tmpfs file and removes the file after
reading. The orchestrator-side switch to file-mode is tracked as a
follow-up; see [SECURITY.md §14](./SECURITY.md#known-limitations).

### Updating

Releases follow weekly cadence. Every Monday at 02:30 UTC, the
weekly-version-bump workflow tags `vX.Y.(Z+1)` and the publish workflow
rebuilds every image with `--no-cache: true` (so Debian package security
updates land), runs Grype, and pushes to GHCR.

To consume a release as a project:

```yaml
# in runner.yml
version: "1.1.2"
runtime: node:24
```

To trigger a manual release:

```bash
gh workflow run weekly-version-bump.yml -f bump_type=patch  # or minor / major
```
